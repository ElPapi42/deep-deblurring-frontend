# Deep Deblurring Frontend
This Vue.js application serves as access point of general public to the image restoration application, setup a minimum viable UI for consume the API defined by [Deep Deblurring Backend](https://github.com/ElPapi42/deep-deblurring-backend).

On the next image we can visualize the general architecture of Deep Deblurring Application (Renamed in this web app as DeepPNG, taking inspiration from [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/) and reflexing the Deep Learning foundation of the this project). On the consumers area, we can see this Vue Frontend Application and of course, the 3rd party direct consumers of the API.

This Vue application is not the state of the art in Frontend Engineering well practices (Checkout AppProcessor.vue component, what a mess there), in fact, im a novice in matter of Frontend Development, i just take two days to learn all the basics of Vue.js, and then, open my path as possible to bring to life this application to a minimum viable state in two weeks. At least, this is a prove of my fast-learning skills.
